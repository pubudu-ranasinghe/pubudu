Let me start by making a disclaimer. This article is not an opinion piece, it does not have a clear objective or an elegant flow of ideas (as you may very well understand in the preceding sections), nor does it have key takeaways or a profound conclusion. This is just a personal note where I try to gather some of my thoughts on this subject and share it with fellow colleagues.

With the advent of AI, it's particularly challenging to be a software engineer (or any technical professional) in 2025. While we've long been the champions of change—moving fast and breaking things even faster—the world is now accelerating at a pace that feels unprecedented, even to us.

On one hand, there's the constant deluge of news, rich getting richer setting historical records, trillion dollar investments on AI infrastructure, new frontier models being announced every other week, AI slop machines reaching the uncanny valley and the world seems to be descending into chaos. On the other hand one needs to juggle the day to day office work, which seems to be getting even worse.

To be clear, I am not against AI—far from it. I was one of the early adopters and advocates of AI within my peer groups. It has become an indispensable tool in my everyday work, and I champion its potential.
