Did you know that OpenType fonts come with a bunch of features that can make the text look better and easier to read? These features were often hidden away in complex design/typesetting software, so most designers and developers weren’t aware of them.

Now, with modern webfonts and improved browser support, you can just turn these on with a bit of CSS.

{/* > OpenType features are like secret compartments in fonts. Unlock them and you'll find ways to make fonts look and behave differently in subtle and dramatic ways. Not all OpenType features are appropriate to use all of the time, but some features are critical for great typography.<span> Tim Brown, Head of Typography at Adobe.</span> */}

### Standard Ligatures

Ligatures occur when two or more characters are joined together to form a single glyph. For instance when the letters "f" and "i" are next to each other the hood of the "f" can collide with the dot of the "i". A ligature can replace this with a combination that is designed to look better. Often these are enabled by default in most fonts.

<Tabs
  tabs={[
    { id: "tab1", label: "Ligatures On" },
    { id: "tab2", label: "Ligatures Off" },
  ]}
>
  <div slot="tab1" class="eb-garamond ligatures-on text-2xl md:text-4xl">
    Offline ff fi fl ffi ffl
  </div>
  <div slot="code1">

```css
font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures;
```

  </div>
  <div slot="tab2" class="eb-garamond ligatures-off text-2xl md:text-4xl">
    Offline ff fi fl ffi ffl
  </div>
  <div slot="code2">

```css
font-variant-ligatures: none;
```

  </div>
</Tabs>

### Discretionary Ligatures

Discretionary ligatures are to be used at the discretion of the designer. Most of the time they are more decorative and not essential for readability.

<Tabs
  tabs={[
    { id: "tab1", label: "Discretionary On" },
    { id: "tab2", label: "Discretionary Off" },
  ]}
>
  <div slot="tab1" class="eb-garamond discretionary-on text-2xl md:text-4xl">
    Connecting ct sp st
  </div>
  <div slot="code1">

    ```css
    font-variant-ligatures: discretionary-ligatures;
    ```

  </div>
  <div slot="tab2" class="eb-garamond discretionary-off text-2xl md:text-4xl">
    Connecting ct sp st
  </div>
  <div slot="code2">

```css
font-variant-ligatures: none;
```

  </div>
</Tabs>

### Old Style Figures

Old style numbers have varying heights and alignments to make them blend in better with lower case letters. These are designed to be used inline with a body of text.

<Tabs
  tabs={[
    { id: "tab1", label: "Old Style On" },
    { id: "tab2", label: "Old Style Off" },
  ]}
>
  <div slot="tab1" class="eb-garamond oldstyle-on text-2xl md:text-4xl">
    52 apples and 7 bananas
  </div>
  <div slot="code1">

```css
font-variant-numeric: oldstyle-nums;
```

  </div>
  <div slot="tab2" class="eb-garamond oldstyle-off text-2xl md:text-4xl">
    52 apples and 7 bananas
  </div>
  <div slot="code2">
  ```css
  font-variant-numeric: lining-nums;
  ```
  
  </div>
</Tabs>

### Tabular Figures

Tabular figures, as the name implies, are designed to align better in tables. They all have the same width so that they line up nicely in columns.

<Tabs
  tabs={[
    { id: "tab1", label: "Tabular On" },
    { id: "tab2", label: "Tabular Off" },
  ]}
>
  <div slot="tab1" class="caslon tabular-on text-right text-2xl md:text-4xl">
    25 <br />
    345 <br />
    2342
  </div>
  <div slot="code1">
  
  ```css 
  font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums; 
  ```
  
  </div>
  <div slot="tab2" class="caslon tabular-off text-2xl md:text-4xl">
    25 <br />
    345 <br />
    2342
  </div>
  <div slot="code2">

```css
font-variant-numeric: lining-nums;
```

  </div>
</Tabs>

### Ordinals, Fractions and Slashed Zero

These features are useful when displaying number values. Ordinals format the letters in "1st", "2nd", "3rd" to be smaller and raised. Fractions turn "1/2" into a proper fraction glyph.

<Tabs
  tabs={[
    { id: "tab1", label: "On" },
    { id: "tab2", label: "Off" },
  ]}
>
  <div slot="tab1" class="eb-garamond text-2xl md:text-4xl">
    &numero; 9 <span className="diagonal-fractions">3/4</span> between 9
    <span className="ordinal">th</span> and <span className="zero">10</span>
    <span className="ordinal">th</span>
  </div>
  <div slot="code1">

```css
font-feature-settings:
  "frac" 1,
  "ordn" 1;
```

  </div>
  <div slot="tab2" class="eb-garamond text-2xl md:text-4xl">
    &numero; 9 3/4 between 9th and 10th
  </div>
  <div slot="code2">

```css
font-feature-settings:
  "frac" 0,
  "ordn" 0;
```

  </div>
</Tabs>

### Swashes

Swashes are decorative pieces often used on start of paragraphs or headings. You may have noticed these on the start paragraphs in books or magazines.

<Tabs
  tabs={[
    { id: "tab1", label: "Swashes On" },
    { id: "tab2", label: "Swashes Off" },
  ]}
>
  <div slot="tab1" class="eb-garamond swashes-on text-2xl italic md:text-4xl">
    Queen Elizabeth
  </div>
  <div slot="code1">
  
  ```css 
  font-feature-settings: "swsh" 1; 
  ```

  </div>
  <div slot="tab2" class="eb-garamond swashes-off text-2xl italic md:text-4xl">
    Queen Elizabeth
  </div>
  <div slot="code2">

```css
font-feature-settings: "swsh" 0;
```

  </div>
</Tabs>

### Small Caps/Petite Caps

Small caps are uppercase letters that are the same height as lowercase letters. These are often used for acronyms or at the start of paragraphs. Some fonts also come with petite caps which are even smaller than small caps.

<Tabs
  tabs={[
    { id: "tab1", label: "Normal Text" },
    { id: "tab2", label: "Small Caps" },
    { id: "tab3", label: "Petite Caps" },
  ]}
>
  <div slot="tab1" class="eb-garamond text-2xl md:text-4xl">
    Sir Issac Newton
  </div>
  <div slot="code1">

```css
font-variant-caps: normal;
```

  </div>
  <div slot="tab2" class="eb-garamond small-caps-on text-2xl md:text-4xl">
    Sir Issac Newton
  </div>
  <div slot="code2">
  
  ```css 
  font-variant-caps: small-caps; 
  ```

  </div>
  <div slot="tab3" class="eb-garamond petite-caps-on text-2xl md:text-4xl">
    Sir Issac Newton
  </div>
  <div slot="code3">
  
  ```css 
  font-variant-caps: petite-caps; 
  ```
  
  </div>
</Tabs>
