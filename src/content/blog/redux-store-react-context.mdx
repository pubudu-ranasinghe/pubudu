Redux has been the go-to solution for React state management for years, but React's Context API offers a simpler alternative for many use cases. Let's build a Redux-like store from scratch.

## Why Context Instead of Redux?

While Redux is powerful, it comes with overhead:

- Additional dependencies
- Boilerplate code
- Learning curve for new developers

For small to medium applications, Context can provide similar benefits with less complexity.

## Building the Store

Here's a minimal implementation of a Redux-like store using Context:

```typescript
import { createContext, useContext, useReducer } from 'react';

type Action = { type: string; payload?: any };
type State = { [key: string]: any };

const StoreContext = createContext<{
  state: State;
  dispatch: (action: Action) => void;
} | null>(null);

export function StoreProvider({ reducer, initialState, children }) {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
  
  return (
    <StoreContext.Provider value={{ state, dispatch }}>
      {children}
    </StoreContext.Provider>
  );
}

export const useStore = () => {
  const context = useContext(StoreContext);
  if (!context) throw new Error('useStore must be used within StoreProvider');
  return context;
};
```

## Using the Store

Wrap your app with the provider and use the custom hook:

```typescript
const reducer = (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'INCREMENT':
      return { count: state.count + 1 };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

function App() {
  return (
    <StoreProvider reducer={reducer} initialState={{ count: 0 }}>
      <Counter />
    </StoreProvider>
  );
}
```

## When to Use This Pattern

This approach works well when you need:

- Shared state across multiple components
- Predictable state updates
- Simple debugging without dev tools

For larger applications with complex async logic, Redux or Zustand might still be better choices.
