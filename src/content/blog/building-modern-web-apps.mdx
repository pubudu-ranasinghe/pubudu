The web development landscape has evolved dramatically. Modern frameworks and tools have made it easier than ever to build fast, accessible, and maintainable applications.

## The Modern Stack

Today's web applications benefit from:

- **Static Site Generation**: Pre-render pages for better performance
- **TypeScript**: Type safety across the entire stack
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Reusable, testable UI components
- **Edge Computing**: Deploy closer to users for lower latency

## Choosing the Right Framework

The choice of framework depends on your project needs:

### Astro
Perfect for content-heavy sites. Ships zero JavaScript by default, with islands of interactivity when needed.

### Next.js
Full-stack React framework with excellent developer experience. Great for dynamic applications.

### SvelteKit
Minimal JavaScript, maximum performance. Compile-time magic that results in tiny bundles.

## Best Practices

Regardless of the framework you choose, focus on:

1. **Performance**: Measure and optimize Core Web Vitals
2. **Accessibility**: Build for everyone, not just the majority
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with HTML, enhance with JavaScript
4. **Developer Experience**: Fast feedback loops improve productivity

## Looking Ahead

The future is exciting: WASM for compute-heavy tasks, better bundlers, improved testing tools, and AI-assisted development. The fundamentals remain the sameâ€”build with users in mind.
